        <h2>Strengts, what do I do best and what are my positive traits?</h2>
        <p>
          A strength of mine is that once i am invested in something i will try my hardest to complete it and achieve my end goals.
        </p>

        <h2>Weaknesses, what personality traits may hold me back in my studies / career?</h2>
        <p>
          One weakness of mine is that im bad at planning ahead, this means that i might get into trouble when i have a project which will take a long time.
          Besides that are being introverted and struggling to ask for help weaknesses of mine. 
          Being introverted makes it hard to work together with people and my struggle with asking for help may inpact my abilty to succeed in my study / career.
        </p>

        <h2>Opportunities, how can I turn these strenghts and weaknesses into opportunities?</h2>
        <p>
          When i am working in a group this will make me less likely to procrastinate,
          on top of that it will give me motivation to continue because i can see other people working.
          So while being introverted and being afraid of working in a group with other people may be a weakness of mine, I believe i can still turn this into an opportunity.
        </p>

        <h2>Threats, what obstacles do I face to succeed as a student, and could any of weaknesses prevent me from succeeding in my study / career?</h2>
        <p>
          Lack of motivation is definitely an obstacle for me that can prevent me from succeeding in things.
          I am willing to work in this though.
