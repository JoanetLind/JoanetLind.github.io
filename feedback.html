        <h2>The feedback i got from my SKC assignment.</h2>
        <p>
            Your motivation is nice but still a bit too general, 
            problem solving is a crucial part of ICT but besides that I recommend you check what interests you most about this type of career, 
            why ICT? 
            What sounds good in this career for you? 
            and to search for the true motivation that will keep you going throughout the study program. 
            This will be very helpful in difficult situations or challenges that you may encounter during your education.
            <hr>
            When looking at your goals after completing your studies again I would recommend you try and research more, 
            maybe search the career opportunities that interest you in ICT, technologies, aspects, or areas, 
            what would you like to do in your day to day? 
            How would you like your role to look like? 
            Look more into the program, what interests you in the courses taught. 
            I also recommend you participate in the ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get more information about different professions in the ICT field.
           <hr>
            Looking at your personal analysis, it is noticeable you gave some thought to your weaknesses and strengths. 
            Determination and hard work are very helpful. 
            Looking at your weaknesses, admitting them is a great step in learning to handle them and preventing them from becoming threats. 
            Being introverted may cause the group projects to not be as easy at first, but don’t worry, 
            with time and within the program it will slowly become easier, 
            <hr>
            as you mentioned there are benefits to working in groups as you can learn from and motivate each other. 
            Regarding the planning, it may be helpful to look at methods and tools that may help you learn scheduling and organization with your tasks. 
            At the program we encourage asking for help and I hope you will feel more comfortable doing it, 
            there will be assistance from fellow students, student assistants, study career coaches, and the lecturers. 
            Discussing with them the lack of motivation and preparing for such situations in advance will help prevent it from harming your progress at the studies.
            <hr>
            To prepare for the studies, you can look at the material and classes overview of the program, 
            there is a small coding exercise at the SKC page which may help you prepare for the first assignment. 
            Besides that it is more mental preparation for the schedule, the deadline and projects that will come. 
            Don’t be too nervous because youll learn everything, and it will all work out well.
        </p>

        <h2>My thoughts on the feedback.</h2>
        <p>
            This feedback helped me in the way that I was not as stressed for this study as I was before.
            I also looked at my motivation and to prepare for my study I did do the preparation assignment.
            When doing the assignment of my portfolio I looked into possible career paths.
            I have not yet looked into help for planning etc.
