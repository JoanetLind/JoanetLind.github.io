        <h2>Why exactly do I think the ICT programme suits me?</h2>
        <p>
          The ICT programme has always sounded interesting to me, 
          and I think the reason behind that is that i have always been curious about how things actually work. 
          Besides, I also really like problem solving. 
          Right now I find the programming aspect of ICT the most exciting part of this programme. 
          Like I said before, I have always been very curious about how things work and to make things work yourself through programming is something that I really enjoy. 
          When i finally solve a problem it makes me feel really happy and as if I have accomplished something, this is important to me because it makes me feel useful. 
          But why specifically ICT and not some other field of work? 
          Computers make sense to me as opposed to people. 
          On top of that is the field always changing and improving which keeps things interesting. 
          This is very important to me as well because I do no want to feel bored.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is also a lot of work in the field of ICT, 
          so after I have finised this programme there will probably be enough job opportunities. 
          Like i said before, this field constantly changing which makes it even more interesting. 
          There will always be new things to discover and more to learn and to improve myself and other things.
